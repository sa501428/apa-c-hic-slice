BEDPE format

We have defined a new file format, the browser extensible data paired-end (BEDPE) format, in order to concisely describe disjoint genome features, such as structural variations or paired-end sequence alignments. We chose to define a new format because the existing “blocked” BED format (a.k.a. BED12) does not allow inter-chromosomal feature definitions. In addition, BED12 only has one strand field, which is insufficient for paired-end sequence alignments, especially when studying structural variation.

The BEDPE format is described below. The description is modified from: http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1.

1. chrom1 - The name of the chromosome on which the first end of the feature exists.
Any string can be used. For example, “chr1”, “III”, “myChrom”, “contig1112.23”.
This column is required.
Use “.” for unknown.

2. start1 - The zero-based starting position of the first end of the feature on chrom1.
The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
As with BED format, the start position in each BEDPE feature is therefore interpreted to be 1 greater than the start position listed in the feature. This column is required.
Use -1 for unknown.

3. end1 - The one-based ending position of the first end of the feature on chrom1.
The end position in each BEDPE feature is one-based.
This column is required.
Use -1 for unknown.

4. chrom2 - The name of the chromosome on which the second end of the feature exists.
Any string can be used. For example, “chr1”, “III”, “myChrom”, “contig1112.23”.
This column is required.
Use “.” for unknown.

5. start2 - The zero-based starting position of the second end of the feature on chrom2.
The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
As with BED format, the start position in each BEDPE feature is therefore interpreted to be 1 greater than the start position listed in the feature. This column is required.
Use -1 for unknown.

6. end2 - The one-based ending position of the second end of the feature on chrom2.
The end position in each BEDPE feature is one-based.
This column is required.
Use -1 for unknown.


There are additional columns but we won't care about those.

Sample entries from an typical BEDPE file:

chr1  100   200   chr5  5000  5100  bedpe_example1  30   +  -
chr9  1000  5000  chr9  3000  3800  bedpe_example2  100  +  -

Entries from a BEDPE file with two custom fields added to each record:

chr1  10    20    chr5  50    60    a1     30       +    -  0  1
chr9  30    40    chr9  80    90    a2     100      +    -  2  1
